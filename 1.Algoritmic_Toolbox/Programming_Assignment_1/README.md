# Programming Assignment 1: Introduction

In this programming assignment of the Algorithmic Toolbox class! It consists of seven algorithmic problems. The first three problems require you just to implement carefully the algorithms covered in the lectures. The remaining four problems will require you to first design an algorithm and then to implement it. For all the problems, we provide starter solutions in C++, Java, and Python3. These solutions implement straightforward naive algorithms that turn out to be slow. To verify this, you may want to submit these solutions to the grader. This will usually give you a “time limit exceeded” message for Python starter files and either “time limit exceeded” or “wrong answer” message for C++ and Java solutions (the reason for wrong answer being an integer overflow issue). Your goal is to replace a naive algorithm with an efficient one.
