# Master Algorithmic Programming Techniques
Learn algorithms through programming and advance your software engineering or data science career.

This is repository where I will be posting the solutions that I come up with for the [Master Algorithmic Programming Techniques](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/data-structures-algorithms) specialization.  

## ATTENTION:  SPECIALIZATION STUDENTS
If you are a current Master Algorithmic Programming Techniques student at Coursera who has not yet made a final submission of this assignment, then looking at this solution for any amount of time constitutes a violation of Coursera's Honor Code.

## Specialization Description
The Specialization covers algorithmic techniques for solving problems arising in computer science applications. It is a mix of theory and practice: you will not only design algorithms and estimate their complexity, but you will get a deeper understanding of algorithms by implementing them in the programming language of your choice.
