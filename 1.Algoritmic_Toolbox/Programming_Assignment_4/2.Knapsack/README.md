## Problem Description
**Task.** Given 𝑛 gold bars,  nd the maximum weight of gold that  ts into a bag of capacity 𝑊 .

**Input Format.** The first line of the input contains the capacity 𝑊 of a knapsack and the number 𝑛 of bars of gold. The next line contains 𝑛 integers 𝑤0 , 𝑤1 , . . . , 𝑤𝑛−1 de ning the weights of the bars of gold.

**Output Format.** Output the maximum weight of gold that  ts into a knapsack of capacity 𝑊 .

### Sample
Input:
```
10 3
1 4 8
```
Output:
