# Last Digit of a Large Fibonacci Number

## Problem Introduction
Your goal in this problem is to find the last digit of n-th Fibonacci number. Recall that Fibonacci numbers grow exponentially fast. For example,
``` F200 = 280571172992510140037611932413038677189525. ```
Therefore, a solution like
```
F[0] = 0
F[1] = 1 
for i from 2 to n:
	F[i] = F[i - 1] + F[i - 2]
print(F[n] mod 10)
```
will turn out to be too slow, because as i grows the ith iteration of the loop computes the sum of longer and longer numbers. Also, for example, F1000 does not fit into the standard C++ int type. To overcome this difficulty, you may want to store in F[i] not the ith Fibonacci number itself, but just its last digit (that is, Fi mod 10). Computing the last digit of Fi is easy: it is just the last digit of the sum of the last digits of Fi-1 and Fi-2:
``` F[i] = (F[i - 1] + F[i - 2]) mod 10 ```
This way, all F[i]â€™s are just digits, so they fit perfectly into any standard integer type, and computing a sum of F [i - 1] and F [i - 2] is performed very quickly.

## Problem Description
**Task.** Given an integer n, find the last digit of the nth Fibonacci number Fn (that is, Fn mod 10).
**Input Format.** The input consists of a single integer n.
**Constraints.** 0 <= n <= 10^7.
**Output Format.** Output the last digit of Fn.
